Made an full-stack project centered around an open-source platform where publishers can post assignments and contributors can take on these tasks and complete them. This project is designed to facilitate seamless collaboration between publishers and contributors by providing a detailed overview of all participants and projects. The platform includes comprehensive profiles for publishers, contributors, and projects, ensuring that all relevant information is easily accessible. While the core functionality has been implemented, the project is still a work in progress and not yet fully operational.
